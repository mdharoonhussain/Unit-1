So first of all , my name is Md. Haroon Hussain and I am from Mechanical background. I completed my bachaelor's degree in 2021 and then i started my job in manufacturing company. But i was not satisfy with my job . Then I searched on google about development field and then i get to know about Masai School . It is a skill-building school in which all the instructors trained the students to crack any interview in the company with zero '0' money. Then I decided to shift my career in the development sector. And after joining Masai School , my all timings were changed. Now i get very confidence about my coding and dsa. And lastly I say that I took a very great decision in joining Masai.
